"All I Want For Christmas Is You"

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

All I want for Christmas is you, baby

            Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ,
            observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration
            among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian 
            liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity 
            Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the 
            West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a 
            public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of 
            Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral 
            part of the holiday season organized around it.
            <br>
            The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the
            New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with 
            messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no 
            room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, 
            with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word.
